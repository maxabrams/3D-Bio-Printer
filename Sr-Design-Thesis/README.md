# Sr-design-thesis

Each chapter should be its own .tex file.
They are all compiled together in master.tex

scu-thesis.cls should have most of the styling that is necessary for the document.

Install latex:
sudo apt-get install texlive-latex-base


sudo apt-get install texlive-latex-extra


To convert from .tex to pdf:
Pdflatex  whatever the .tex file is but without the .tex  (do this a few times)
